TurntablePythonBot
==================

A Turntable.fm bot written in Python using [ttapi from alaingilbert](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API)

I've seen a few different TT bots, and I wanted to take the opportunity to write my own and use some of what I've been learning as I've been learning Python.

Feel free to borrow anything that you find helpful, even though I don't think there is anything too terribly original in here. 

Eventually I intended to clean up some of the patterns and make this less procedural, but that will depend upon my progress with the Python learning. For now, it seems to be doing what I want it do.
